        PetPlate is an online delivery service that sells healthy food for dogs through
        personalized meal plans. Guava team and I helped rebrand their website and
        designed a new subscription flow, user profile, and order management. We also
        delivered a new one-off ordering flow for their functional foods. I articulated
        requirements with stakeholders, conducted usability tests with users, and
        produced new PDPs + a fast checkout system. Now, customers can fulfill an order
        with only three steps and less than a minute.
